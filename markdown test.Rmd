```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

# Example Plot
Here is a simple plot using the **Gapminder** dataset:

```{r example-plot, echo=TRUE}
# Install and load the Gapminder package if necessary
# install.packages("gapminder")
library(gapminder)
library(ggplot2)

# Create a plot
gapminder_2007 <- subset(gapminder, year == 2007)
ggplot(gapminder_2007, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, color = continent)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_log10() +
  labs(title = "Life Expectancy vs GDP Per Capita in 2007",
       x = "GDP per Capita (log scale)",
       y = "Life Expectancy")
```

And here we are testing the bibliography function [@challies_governance_2019] 

# Notes
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
