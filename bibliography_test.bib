	abstract = {Telecoupling describes specific global flows and interconnections that pose novel challenges for sustainability governance. This chapter examines contributions to the governance literature that have addressed aspects of global interconnectedness and that might inform a more systematic engagement with and theorisation of the phenomenon of telecoupling and its implications for sustainability governance. The chapter explores key dimensions of governance that, it is argued, take on new importance in light of telecoupling, addressing the multiple governing actors, cross-scalar dynamics and multiple governance modes implicated. A number of important challenges facing sustainability governance in telecoupled systems are discussed, along with potential means to address these.},
